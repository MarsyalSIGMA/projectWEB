            <p>MK X characters select menu allows player to choose their favorite character. There is 35 characters and each characters have 3 variants. That is mean player can choose 35 and 105 total variants. <br> <br>
                The characters are arranged in a grid format, with rows and columns showing all available fighters. Each character is represented by a square portrait that highlights their appearance. <br> <br>
               Once a character is selected, the menu gives you the option to choose between three different fighting variations. These variations alter the character's abilities and moves, making the selection process more strategic. <br><br>

        <p class="tips-trick">
            <span>1. Learn Basic Combos</span>
            <br>
            Each character has a set of basic combos. Spend time in practice mode mastering these. Understanding how to string together attacks smoothly is key to creating offensive pressure.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>2. Use Environment Interactions</span>
            <br>
            MKX has stage interactions, allowing you to use objects in the background to attack or escape. Don't forget to use these to either deal damage or reposition yourself when necessary.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>3. Master Blocking</span>
            <br>
            Blocking is crucial for defense. Hold the block button to guard against high and mid-attacks, but you’ll need to crouch and block for low attacks. Learning when to block and counterattack is key to your defense.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>4. Mix-Up Your Attacks</span>
            <br>
            Mix up high, mid, and low attacks to keep your opponent guessing. If they block high, hit them with low attacks or sweeps. If they block low, go for overheads or jumping attacks.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>5. Practice Special Moves</span>
            <br>
            Each character has unique special moves. Learn these moves well, as they can be used to extend combos or punish opponents. Mastery of special moves can give you a significant advantage in battle.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>6. Use X-Ray Moves Wisely</span>
            <br>
            X-Ray moves deal a large amount of damage but take time to build up. Don't waste it early in the round. Save it for when you know it can make a difference, especially when you're trying to finish off your opponent.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>7. Know Your Character's Strengths and Weaknesses</span>
            <br>
            Every character has strengths (like strong zoning or quick strikes) and weaknesses (like slow recovery). Spend time learning your chosen fighter's pros and cons to use them effectively in different matchups.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>8. Breakers for Escape</span>
            <br>
            If you're caught in a combo, don't forget about combo breakers. They can be a lifesaver when your health is low and your opponent has momentum. However, breakers consume a lot of your meter, so use them wisely.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>9. Master Frame Data</span>
            <br>
            Advanced players should familiarize themselves with the frame data of their character and the opponents. Learning frame advantage and how long it takes for moves to recover can help you punish opponents more effectively.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>10. Stay Calm Under Pressure</span>
            <br>
            It’s easy to panic when you’re cornered or under pressure. Stay calm, block carefully, and wait for an opening to counter-attack.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>11. Study Your Opponents</span>
            <br>
            Watch how your opponent plays and adjust accordingly. If they favor a certain strategy (like jumping in or spamming projectiles), find ways to counter those patterns. Adaptation is key in MKX.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>12. Work on Fatalities and Brutalities</span>
            <br>
            Fatalities and Brutalities are fun finishers, but they also give you a mental edge over your opponent. Practice these moves so that you can pull them off easily in matches to demoralize your opponents.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>13. Don’t Spam Moves</span>
            <br>
            While it might be tempting to spam the same move over and over, this makes you predictable. Mix up your attacks and strategies to keep your opponent guessing and avoid being countered easily.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>14. Use Dash Canceling</span>
            <br>
            Dash canceling is a useful technique that lets you cancel certain moves into dashes, allowing you to keep pressure on your opponent or reposition yourself more quickly.
